# Sidekiq::Bouncer

This Ruby gem debounces Sidekiq jobs that have the same worker class and params.

It lets duplicate jobs enqueue. Each time, it refreshes a timestamp in Redis.
When duplicate jobs run, they are checked against this timestamp in Redis and
only the last job will execute.

## Alternatives Considered

This is a home grown solution. We looked at the official V6 recommendation and
top gems from Googling 'sidekiq debounce', but all were too slow or broken.

  1) https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/API

     The official recommendation is to find and delete duplicate jobs before
     enqueuing a new job. V6 introduced `scan` for this purpose, and it is
     1.5x faster than V5's `select` method, but still too slow at high volume.

  2) https://github.com/hummingbird-me/sidekiq-debounce

     The 1st search result. It is outdated and does not work anymore.

  3) https://github.com/paladinsoftware/sidekiq-debouncer

     The 2nd search result. Still works, but it uses the slow `select` method.

## Performance

For each duplicate job, this approach takes 10ms flat; in comparison, `scan`
takes 10ms per each thousand job in the scheduled set, which adds up quickly.
The before (using `scan`) and after (using this gem):

Sidekiq::Bouncer.configure do |config|
  config.redis = Rails.application.redis
end

# app/workers/foo_worker.rb
class FooWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker

  def self.bouncer
    # The default delay is 60 seconds. You can optionally override it.
    @bouncer ||= Sidekiq::Bouncer.new(self, optional_delay_override)
  end

  def perform(param1, param2)
    return unless self.class.bouncer.let_in?(param1, param2)

    # Do your thing.
  end
end

# Call `.bouncer.debounce(...)` in place of `.perform_in/perform_async(...)`.
FooWorker.bouncer.debounce(param1, param2)
```
